- fix float literals in scanner
- fix raw strings --> this was the SPEC'S fault --> clearly not a backtick in the pdf
    - fixed one valid scanner program and both invalid scanner programs
- milestone1 did NOT specify that we had to write the weeder. So it is harsh to take off
anything for not weeding completely
- empty variable and type declarations? Dumb!
- block statements. Dumb!
- switch statements with no expression - so dumb!

TODO
- fix blank identifiers in weeder --> not allowed
- mark interpreted vs raw string literals in scanner and beyond
- block statements -
