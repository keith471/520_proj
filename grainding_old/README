The following programs were used to test GoLite milestones 1 and 2. They are organized as follows:

Scanner tests (section 1 of milestone 1):
	invalid/scanner
	valid/scanner

Parser tests (section 2 of milestone 1):
	invalid/parser
	valid/parser

Typechecker tests (milestone 2):
	invalid/typechecker
	valid/typechecker

To pass an invalid test, you must reject the file.
To pass a valid test, you must correctly parse all parts of the test case.

NOTE: THE PROGRAMS ARE BEING DISTRIBUTED TO HELP WITH FIXING YOUR COMPILER. THEY MAY NOT *UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES* BE DISTRIBUTED PUBLICLY OR TO FUTURE STUDENTS. DOING SO IS AN ACADEMIC OFFENCE AND WILL BE TREATED AS SUCH.

THIS MEANS, IF YOU INTEND TO MAKE YOUR CODE ACCESSIBLE AFTER THE COURSE, YOU *MUST NOT* INCLUDE THEM IN YOUR REPOSITORY.
